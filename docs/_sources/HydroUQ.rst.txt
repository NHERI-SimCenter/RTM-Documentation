The purpose of presenting these requirements is to inform the community on the present capabilities of the |app| and features that could be added. The original set of requirements have come from a set of grand challenge reports, **GC**. These original requirements have been broken into a smaller set of deliverable features by the senior faculty associated with the project, **SP**. Additional requirements have come from users, **U** See section :ref:`features` if you have additional features you would like to see.
